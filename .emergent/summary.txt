The previous AI engineer initiated the Rihla travel platform, starting with frontend development based on an Airbnb-like model and mock data. Initially, a green/black/white color scheme was adopted. A user-provided logo then caused confusion, leading to an attempt to switch to an orange/red palette, which was subsequently corrected back to the original green/black/white upon user clarification. The frontend achieved 100% functionality with mock data for features like authentication and experience creation, validated through screenshots and automated tests. Recently, the user requested to develop the backend and ensure seamless frontend communication. The AI engineer is now in the process of building a new TypeScript backend, having set up the project, models, middleware, controllers, and is currently working on routes, abandoning the initial FastAPI backend implied by the initial context.

<product_requirements>
The project is Rihla, a Moroccan travel services and booking platform, aiming for a complete frontend and UI integrated with an existing (or to be developed) backend. It should be an Airbnb-like platform, catering to travelers seeking authentic Moroccan experiences and hosts offering services.

**Brand Identity:**
- **Logo:** Stylized R with a map pin. Initially, a green/black/white gradient was requested. A user uploaded a logo which was misinterpreted as orange/red, but later confirmed to be green/black/white, which is the current implemented palette.
- **Slogan:** Where journeys meet people.
- **Tone:** Friendly, trustworthy, professional.

**Frontend Objectives:**
- Fully responsive design (desktop + mobile).
- Clear separation of traveler and host dashboards.
- Secure login, registration, and profile management.
- Search, filter, and booking UI.
- Messaging system UI.
- Reviews and ratings display.
- Forms & Validation: intuitive, user-friendly forms.

**Technical Guidance:**
- **Frontend:** React.js with TailwindCSS and Shadcn/UI components.
- **State Management:** React Hooks and Context API.
- **API Integration:** Consume backend endpoints for authentication, booking, messaging, and reviews.
- **Routing & Navigation:** React Router.

**Current Implementation State:**
The frontend is fully functional with mock data, correctly implementing the green/black/white color palette. Core features like homepage, search, authentication (with Demo Login), user/host dashboards, and experience creation are visually and functionally complete using mock data. The AI has started building a new TypeScript backend to replace the initial FastAPI one, as requested by the user.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React.js (v19), TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI, React Router DOM (v6), Axios for API calls, React Hooks, Context API.
- **Backend (Original):** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (Motor AsyncIO client), Pydantic for models.
- **Backend (New):** TypeScript, Express.js (implied by typical TS backend setups for controllers/routes), MongoDB (likely Mongoose/Prisma for TS integration), JWT for authentication.
- **Development Tools:** Yarn for package management, Supervisor for service control.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The codebase is structured into  and  directories, with a new  directory being developed for a TypeScript backend.



- ****: Initial FastAPI backend providing basic  and  endpoints. It includes MongoDB connection and CORS middleware. This backend is currently not being actively developed, as the user requested a TypeScript backend.
- ****: The main React application entry point. It handles routing with  and  from . It was modified multiple times to update routing and integrate new pages. It initially had a Hello World API call to the Python backend.
- ****: Global CSS, primarily for TailwindCSS setup and defining custom CSS variables for the color palette ( and  themes). It was significantly modified to implement the green/black/white gradient color scheme requested by the user, after a temporary change to orange/red.
- ****: Stores all mock data used by the frontend components. This file is crucial for the frontend-only functionality, allowing the app to appear complete before backend integration.
- ****: These files represent the various pages of the application (Home, SearchPage, Login, Register, Dashboard, CreateExperience, etc.). They integrate Shadcn/UI components and utilize mock data. All these files were modified to reflect the green/black/white branding.  and  were specifically updated for functionality and correct styling.
- ****: This new directory houses the emerging TypeScript backend.
    - ****: Configures the TypeScript backend project, listing dependencies like , , , , , and development scripts.
    - ****: TypeScript compiler configuration.
    - ****: The main entry point for the TypeScript backend, setting up the Express app, connecting to the database, and integrating middleware and routes.
    - ****: Handles MongoDB connection logic for the TypeScript backend.
    - ****: Defines Mongoose schemas and models for MongoDB collections (User, Experience, Booking, Message, Review).
    - ****: Implements middleware for authentication (), error handling (), and request validation ().
    - ****: Contains the business logic for handling various API endpoints, separated by resource (auth, user, experience, booking, message, review).
- ****: Documents API contracts, mocked data, backend implementation plans, and frontend-backend integration strategy.
- ****: Used by the testing agents to log test results and findings.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of the TypeScript backend routes to connect all controllers to the Express application.
- Integrate the newly developed TypeScript backend with the existing React frontend, replacing mock data with actual API calls.
- Ensure seamless communication between the frontend and the new backend, addressing any bugs.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of building a new TypeScript backend for the Rihla application, following the user's request to developpe le backend et sa communication avec le frontend pour qu il n y ai pas de bug. This new backend is intended to replace the initial FastAPI backend.

So far, the following has been accomplished for the new TypeScript backend:
1.  **Project Setup**: A new directory  was created with  (listing dependencies like , , , , , ), , and initial project structure. yarn install v1.22.22
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
Done in 0.23s. was executed.
2.  **Database Configuration**:  was created to handle MongoDB connection.
3.  **Data Models**: Mongoose schemas and models for , , , , and  have been defined and created in .
4.  **Middleware**: Security and error handling middleware were implemented, including  (for JWT authentication), , and , along with  for JWT utility functions in  and .
5.  **Controllers**: Comprehensive controllers for , , , , , and  have been created in , encapsulating the business logic for each domain.
6.  **Routing**: The next step the AI was working on was creating the final routes to connect these controllers to the Express application. The last message in the trajectory states, Maintenant, cr√©ons toutes les routes pour connecter les controllers :.

The frontend is fully functional with mock data, adhering to the green/black/white branding. Authentication via Demo Login and experience creation are working, and all pages (Home, Search, Login, Register, Dashboards, Details, etc.) are visually complete and responsive.

<optional_next_step>
Complete the implementation of all backend routes in the TypeScript application to connect the controllers.
